    "## CheckInOut System Database - B+ Tree DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "# üìú Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "In large-scale systems like a college hostel and guesthouse management system (CheckInOut System), efficient storage and retrieval of data is crucial. \n",
    "A traditional database approach may lead to inefficient search times especially when handling thousands of records for Students, Staff, Visitors, and Room Allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a custom lightweight Database Management System (DBMS) using **B+ Trees** for indexing. \n",
    "The B+ Tree indexing allows faster search, insertion, deletion, and range queries by maintaining a balanced multi-level structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our proposed solution enhances performance for the CheckInOut System by:\n",
    "- Reducing query times.\n",
    "- Supporting efficient bulk insertions and deletions.\n",
    "- Allowing fast range queries (e.g., list all students with IDs between 1000 and 2000).\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The database system has been built modularly with the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Class** (`Database`):\n",
    "    - Manages multiple tables.\n",
    "    - Supports create, insert, update, delete, select, range query, and aggregation operations.\n",
    "    - Supports saving and loading the database from disk (using pickle).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Table Class** (`Table`):\n",
    "    - Represents a table with columns and a primary key.\n",
    "    - Each table maintains an index using either:\n",
    "        - **BPlusTree** (efficient indexing).\n",
    "        - **BruteForceDB** (for testing without indexing).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BPlusTree Class**:\n",
    "    - Self-balancing tree structure.\n",
    "    - Supports fast insertion, deletion, and search in `O(log n)` time.\n",
    "    - Leaf nodes are linked for efficient range queries.\n",
    "    - Inner nodes store keys for navigation but only leaf nodes store actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core B+ Tree Operations Implemented:\n",
    "- **Insertion**: New keys are inserted into leaf nodes. When a node overflows, it splits and promotes the middle key.\n",
    "- **Searching**: Traverse from root to leaf to find the required key.\n",
    "- **Deletion**: Remove key from the leaf. If a node underflows, merge or redistribute keys.\n",
    "- **Range Query**: Utilize linked leaves to fetch keys within a given range efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture ensures scalable, fast operations crucial for real-world databases like CheckInOut.\n",
