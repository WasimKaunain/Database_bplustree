# Database_bplustree
# Database Management System

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **CheckInOut** Database Management System! This project provides a lightweight, file-based database management system featuring:

- Database creation and persistence.
- Table creation and deletion.
- Insert, update, delete, search, and range queries.
- Dashboard interface to manage operations.
- Performance comparison between naive list-based storage and a B+ Tree index.

## üöÄ Beginner Tutorial to Run the App

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
https://https://github.com/WasimKaunain/Database_bplustree
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the App:**

```bash
python app.py
```

4. **Access the Dashboard:**

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

5. **Using the Dashboard:**
   - Choose "Create Database" to create a new one.
   - Choose "Use Existing Database" to select from pre-existing databases (like `checkinout`).
   - Perform operations like insert, update, delete, search, range queries, and display all records easily.

6. **Performance Testing:**
   - Go to the **Performance Check** section.
   - Compare search, insert, delete, and range query times between **Naive List** vs **B+ Tree** using graphs.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Setup & Management

### 1. Index / Landing Page  
![Index Page](Screenshots/Index.png)  
Homepage where we have two options : Use an Existing database or create a new database

### 2. Existing Database List and Option to Choose Database  
![Existing Databases](Screenshots/Existing_database_list_and_option_to_choose_database.png)  
Here we have already two databases named Checkinout and Testing. We will use Checkinout database

### 3. Add New Database  
![Add New Database](Screenshots/add_new_database.png)  
Here we have an option to create a new database by entering its name.

## üè† Dashboard & Landing

### 4. Database Dashboard with Tables & Performance Button  
![Database Dashboard](Screenshots/Database_dashboard_showing_list_of_all_tables_in_left_pane_with_performance_check_button.png)  
This is Database dashboard where left pane shows the list of tables this database have and a Performance Button which takes us to Performance Analyzer dashboard.
Here we have options of Creating new table, deleting a table and Choosing a perticular table.
We will choose here students table as we had populated this table for testing.


### 5. Create New Table Form
![Create New Table](Screenshots/Create_new_table_form.png)
Create Table form page


### 6. Table Dashboard with diffrent Functionalities
![Table dashboard](Screenshots/table_dashboard.png)
This is a table dashboard page where various functionalities are given


## üìã Records Management

### 7. Insert Record  
![Insert Record](Screenshots/insert_record.png)  
This page is for inserting single records in that selected table

### 8. Display All Records  
![Display Records](Screenshots/display_all_record.png)  
It will display all the records in that selected table

### 9. Delete Record  
![Delete Record](Screenshots/delete_record.png)  
It will delete single record in that selected table

### 10. Range Query Results  
![Range Query](Screenshots/range_query_record.png)  
It will display all the records within that range of selected table

### 11. Search Record  
![Search Record](Screenshots/search_record.png)  
It will display the record being searched in that selected table

### 12. Update Record  
![update Record](Screenshots/update_record.png)  
It will upfate the record in that selected table

## üìä Performance Analysis

### 13. Performance Check Dashboard  
![Performance Dashboard](Screenshots/performance_check_dashboard.png)  
Here we have multiple performance check options on B+ tree vs Brute Force method indexing.
First, we have to select no. of rows on which we are doing performance check.

### 14. Insertion Time Result Chart  
![Insertion Time Chart](Screenshots/measure_insertion_time_result_chart.png)  
Show Performance Graph on doing insertion between B+ Tree and Brute Force method.

### 15. Deletion Time Result Chart  
![Deletion Time Chart](Screenshots/measure_deletion_time_result_chart.png)  
Show Performance Graph on doing deletion between B+ Tree and Brute Force method.

### 16. Search Time Result Chart  
![Search Time Chart](Screenshots/measure_searching_time_result_chart.png)  
Show Performance Graph on doing searching between B+ Tree and Brute Force method.

### 17. Range Query Time Result Chart  
![Range Query Time Chart](Screenshots/measure_range_query_time_result_chart.png)  
Show Performance Graph on doing range query between B+ Tree and Brute Force method.
