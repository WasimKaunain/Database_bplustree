# Database_bplustree# CheckInOut Database Management System

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **CheckInOut** Database Management System! This project provides a lightweight, file-based database management system featuring:

- Database creation and persistence.
- Table creation and deletion.
- Insert, update, delete, search, and range queries.
- Dashboard interface to manage operations.
- Performance comparison between naive list-based storage and a B+ Tree index.

## ðŸš€ Beginner Tutorial to Run the App

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
https://https://github.com/WasimKaunain/Database_bplustree
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the App:**

```bash
python app.py
```

4. **Access the Dashboard:**

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

5. **Using the Dashboard:**
   - Choose "Create Database" to create a new one.
   - Choose "Use Existing Database" to select from pre-existing databases (like `checkinout`).
   - Perform operations like insert, update, delete, search, range queries, and view records easily.

6. **Performance Testing:**
   - Go to the **Performance Analysis** section.
   - Compare search, insert, delete, and range query times between **Naive List** vs **B+ Tree** using graphs.

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Flask** (for dashboard web interface)
- **HTML/CSS** (for simple frontend forms)
- **Matplotlib** (for performance plotting)
- **Custom Database Management System** (developed from scratch)
- **B+ Tree Data Structure** (for indexing and fast searching)
